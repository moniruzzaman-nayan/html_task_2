	<h1> When can Bangladesh expect a <strong> Covid-19 </strong>  vaccine? </h1>

	<h2> The world has finally got two Covid-19 vaccines, which are said to be highly effective. Will the people of Bangladesh have access to those as fast as they expect? Experts say there are challenges. <br> 
   </h2>

	<p> The stunning results from <strong>Covid-19</strong>  vaccine trials by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna raised hopes across the world in the battle against the deadly virus, but experts find big challenges for Bangladesh to avail benefits from the two vaccines due to its existing poor cold chain.

   They said the mRNA technology-based vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer need to be stored at minus 70-80 degrees Celsius temperature, but the country has a cold chain having the capacity of preserving life-saving drugs and children's vaccines at temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius under the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) framework.

   The experts said Bangladesh is also unlikely to be able to enhance its existing capacity for storing, transporting and distributing mRNA vaccines overnight as it is a very expensive and time-consuming process and the required number of refrigerators will not be found within a short time.

   Under the circumstances, they said, the country needs a prudent Covid-19 vaccine policy alongside keeping in touch with all other potential countries and originations that are conducting the phase-III trial of vaccine development so that a suitable vaccine can be procured and maintained using the existing cold chain capacity.
